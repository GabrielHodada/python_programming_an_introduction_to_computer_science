2. On many systems with Python, it is possible to run a program by simply
clicking (or double-clicking) on the icon of the program file. If you are
able to run the convert.py program this way, you may discover another
usability issue. The program starts running in a new window, but as soon
as the program has finished, the window disappears so that you cannot
read the results. Add an input statement at the end of the program so
that it pauses to give the user a chance to read the results. Something like
this should work:
input ("Press the <Enter> key to quit.")
